## Installation
Open windows powershell and run:
```
pip install -U exakt-cast
```

From anaconda powershell run:
```
cast
```

Alternatively you can run :

```
python -m cast.main
```

This should open the Cast app in your browser. 

## Set up

Once the installation is done and the cast app is up and running it is time to set up your directory. 

The directory should have automatically installed within your Documents folder. Open the directory and check that the Cast directory is setup correctly. The following folders should be in the directory: 
```
Cast/
├── configs/
├── data/
│   ├── export/
│   └── source/
├── queries/
└── settings.json
```

### Data folder

The **source** folder is where all the data sources you want to query should be saved. To use a data source in the Cast app, ensure the file is placed in this folder.

The **export** folder stores Parquet files generated when query results are exported. If you have exported the output of a query, you can find it in this folder.

### Queries

The **queries** folder is where all queries written in the Cast app will be saved. Queries are only saved when the save button is selected, as there is no auto-save functionality. 

### Configs

The **configs** folder contains saved data visualizations from the Data Viewer tab. These visualizations are stored as JSON files in the PyGwalker file format and can also be directly opened by PyGwalker.

### Settings

This is a json file that sets all the settings for the Cast app.
