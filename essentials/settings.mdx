In the Cast Directory you will find the **settings.json** file.
This JSON file contains all the settings used by the cast app. When you run cast for the first time it is populated with some default values.
Should you want to change any of the settings you can just make the changes in the  **settings.json** file and restart the Cast app.

### Missing values

This setting allows you select which values should be treated as a missing value in your dataset. You can add and remove to the list as you please. There are some common defaults included to make it easier to get started.

### Numeric Seperator

This setting allows you to change what should be seen as a decimal seperator in numeric data. Common examples may be "," or "."
This setting is used when we try and identify numeric columns to cast. Typically this is required when data is exported to CSV and is not read in as a numeric data type.

### Interactive Limit

This setting allows you to set the number of rows that should be used in the data viewer. However, note that not all devices will be able to run the data viewer on large datasets. In cases like this it may be best to use a sample from the dataset.
