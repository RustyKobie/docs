### Missing values

This setting allows you to setup what should be treated as a missing value in your dataset. You can add and remove to the list as you please. 

### Numeric Seperator

This setting allows you to change what should be seen as a decimal seperator in your data. Common examples may be "," or ".". 

### Interactive Limit

This setting allows you to set the number of rows that should be used in the data viewer. However, note that not all devices will be able to run the data viewer on large datasets. In cases like this it may be best to use a sample from the dataset.
