## Frequently Asked Questions:

- How do I query multiple different flat files in one query?
    - To query a flat file you will only need to reference the file path where it is stored. 
    - As a example use the file path generated from the pre-populated query and substitute the file name. 

- Is it possible to create a temporary table in the query editor or will I have to embed all of the tables?
    -You are welcome to embed tables but the best approach may be to use CTE's.
